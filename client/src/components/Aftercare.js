                  Please leave the bandage on overnight. This will help protect your tattoo from sticking to clothing and bed sheets overnight, and also prevent it from drying out and starting to scab early. In the morning, promptly remove the bandage and wash with hot water and mild soap. Wash gently with your fingertips and rinse with hot water. Pat it dry with a clean paper towel. Try to refrain from using bath towels if possible.
                </p>
                <p className="aftercare-text mb-4">
                  If using saniderm, 2nd skin, tegaderm, etc... type bandages, replace through the first night if fluid build-up happens. Either way, it should be removed the following morning, clean the tattoo, and replace the saniderm once the skin is dry. It can usually remain on the tattoo for 2-4 days at this point without any fluid build-up happening.
                </p>
                <p className="aftercare-text mb-4">
                  On the first day, let the tattoo get as much air as possible. Try to wear light, loose-fitting clothing to avoid smothering the tattoo. Use a mild, fragrance-free, water-based hand lotion (Aveeno, Lubriderm, Curel, etc.).
                </p>
                <p className="aftercare-text mb-4">
                  Please refrain from using any petroleum or oil-based products (Aquaphor, Vaseline, Neosporin, A and D ointment, or any branded tattoo aftercare products unless approved by your tattoo artist). Over-application of these can cause excessive seeping, harbor bacteria, and lead to heavier scabbing and potential infection and scarring.
                </p>
                <p className="aftercare-text mb-4">
                  Refrain from touching or rubbing your new tattoo. If any scabbing develops, do not pick at them. This will lead to prolonged healing time, scarring, and color loss.
                </p>
                <p className="aftercare-text mb-4">
                  Do not use sunblock until the tattoo is fully healed. Avoid swimming or soaking in water for extended periods of time while the tattoo is still healing.
                </p>
                <p className="aftercare-text mb-4">
                  Your tattoo should take approximately 1-2 weeks to heal. It should lightly flake and peel like a sunburn. Sometimes there will be areas of heavier scabbing. Avoid picking scabs and excessive touching or rubbing the tattoo.
